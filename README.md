# 🏠 Airbnb Database Project – ALX Backend ProDev

## About the Project

This project is a part of the ALX Airbnb Database Module, where you will implement advanced SQL querying and optimization techniques to work with a simulated Airbnb database. By diving into real-world challenges like optimizing query performance, writing complex SQL scripts, and applying indexing and partitioning, participants will gain hands-on experience with database management and performance tuning. This ensures you are equipped to handle large-scale applications where efficiency and scalability are critical.

## Learning Objectives

This project is designed to enhance the skills of professional developers by focusing on advanced database concepts and practices. By the end of this project, learners will:

- **Master Advanced SQL:**  
  Write complex queries involving joins, subqueries, and aggregations for data retrieval and analysis.

- **Optimize Query Performance:**  
  Analyze and refactor SQL scripts using performance tools like `EXPLAIN` and `ANALYZE`.

- **Implement Indexing and Partitioning:**  
  Understand and apply indexing and table partitioning to improve database performance for large datasets.

- **Monitor and Refine Performance:**  
  Continuously monitor database health and refine schemas and queries for optimal performance.

- **Think Like a DBA:**  
  Learn to make data-driven decisions about schema design and optimization strategies for high-volume applications.

## Key Features

- Comprehensive ERD and normalized schema design
- Advanced SQL scripts for data manipulation and analysis
- Performance optimization using indexing and partitioning
- Detailed documentation and performance reports

## Getting Started

1. Review the ERD in the `ERD/` folder.
2. Set up the schema using scripts in `database-script-0x01/`.
3. Seed the database with sample data from `database-script-0x02/`.
4. Explore advanced queries and optimizations in `database-adv-script/`.
5. Read the markdown reports for insights into normalization, indexing, partitioning, and performance improvements.
